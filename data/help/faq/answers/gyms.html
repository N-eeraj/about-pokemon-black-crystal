                    Pokémon Gyms offer Pokémon trainers to train their Pokémon to be stronger.
                    A Pokémon gym will have a few trainers and finally a Gym Leader.

            <p>
                On beating the Gym Leader you'll receive a Gym Badge.
                There are 8 Gyms throughout the game, on defeating all the Gym Leaders you'll be able to compete to become the Pokémon champion.
