            Different Pokémon evolve in different ways based on their species.
            Not all Pokémon can evolve.
            The common methods that Pokémon evolve are listed below.

                    Some Pokémon evolve when they are given a specific item.
                    These items are called evolution stones.
                    Each Pokémon have a specific evolution stone required to evolve.
                    The same can't be said about the Pokémon Eevee, it's evolution is a bit different and can be triggered with a few of the evolution stones.
